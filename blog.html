          <h2>2022-02-06: Setting up this blog</h2>
          <p>After spending a frustrating couple of hours trying to  help YR use DVI builder to update their wordpress site, and having DRR remind me that github provides some web space, I decided to have a go and try it out.  I  was only looking for a minimal presence and am more than happy just to handcraft some html and css, so it looks like a good option, particularly as I already have a github account.</p>
 <p>Setting up was very easy.  For my github username  of davidwrobson, I had to create a new git repository called davidwrobson.github.io, choosing the option to create a default README.md file.  I then had to navigate to <b>Settings</b> and then <b>Pages</b> and then under <b>Build and deployment</b>, set "Branch" to "main" and the "folder" to "/ (root)"</p>
<p>Now, under the <b>Code</b> section, it tells me, ...</p>
<pre>
davidwrobson.github.io
This repository can bedownloaded by "git clone git@github.com:DavidWRobson/davidwrobson.github.io.git"
The web pages are available at https://davidwrobson.github.io/
</pre>
<p> the typo is theirs not mine!</p>
<p>After that, it all works.  I already have git installed on my linux laptop, and already have my  ssh  public key installed on github. Now I can update myweb space with local edits followed by got commits and pushes.  The web space is then visible at https://davidwrobson.github.io/</p>

<p>Interestingly, the .io internet domains are for the British Indian Occean Territories, which according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indian_Ocean_Territory">Wikipedia</a>, has a permanent population of one.  He or she must be very busy just managing the domain!</p>
